What is matrix?

matrix is a rectangular array or table of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns, which is used to represent a mathematical object or a property of such an object.

There are many types of matrices available we will discuss some of them here:

1. Horizontal Matrix
The matrix that contains more columns than the number of rows is called a horizontal matrix. 

Example:
int row = 2;
int col = 3;
int a[row][col];

Here a is a horizontal matrix as it has more columns than rows.



2. Vertical Matrix
The matrix that contains more rows than the number of columns is called a vertical matrix.

Example:
int row = 3;
int col = 2;
int b[row][col];

Here b is a vertical matrix as it has more rows than columns.



3. Square Matrix

The matrix that contains the same number of rows as that of columns is called a square matrix.

Example:
int row = 3;
int col = 3;
int c[row][col];
c is a matrix with order 3 x 3. c is a square matrix as the number of rows = the number of columns.



4. Diagonal Matrix

In a diagonal matrix, when we say diagonal, we mean principal diagonal.

A matrix with zero elements except the diagonal elements is called a diagonal matrix.

There is some condition that a matrix should follow to be called a diagonal matrix, and these are:

* The given matrix should be a square matrix, i.e., the number of rows should be the same as the number of columns.
* All the elements except the elements from the principal diagonal must be zero.



5. Scalar Matrix

It is an extension of a diagonal matrix. A matrix that obeys all the conditions of the diagonal matrix and all the elements along the principal diagonal are equal is called a scalar matrix. 


6. Identity or Unit Matrix

Unit matrix is also an extension of the diagonal matrix. A matrix that follows all the diagonal matrix conditions and has all the principal diagonal elements 1 is called an identity or unit matrix.


/* We can have some conclusions regarding the unit matrix.

All identity matrices are scalar matrices.
All scalar matrices are diagonal matrices.
All diagonal matrices are square matrices. */


Two matrices are said to be equal when they follow some conditions.

* The number of rows of both the matrices should be identical.
* The number of columns of both the matrices should be identical.
* All the elements corresponding to the same positions must be equal.

When two matrices that satisfy all of the above conditions are called equal matrices.

7. Triangular Matrix

When a square matrix has all the elements above or below the principal diagonal as zero, the rest have values known as the triangular matrix.
